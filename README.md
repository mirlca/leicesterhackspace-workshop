# Introduction

In this hands-on online workshop, you will explore MIRLC, an easy live coding environment built in SuperCollider to query sounds from Freesound.org, and will be introduced to how machine learning can be useful to improve the live coding experience. The workshop is designed to accommodate both beginners and experts in programming using a team-based learning approach.

# Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes of the workshop are:

- Get a sense of the practice of live coding (music live performance using code) by manipulating online crowdsourced sounds and the automatic use of feature descriptors obtained from Freesound.org.
- Get familiar with the application of neural networks, in particular a multilayer perceptron used as a classifier, to improve the practice of live coding with crowdsourced sounds.
- Be exposed to the main steps to solve a problem using machine learning techniques: the creation of a dataset, training a model, testing the model, and performing with / evaluating the model in an iterative cycle.
- Understand how to combine different technologies in SuperCollider to build a prototype for live coding performance.
- Get insight on a participatory design approach to designing a prototype for live coding performance.

At the end of the workshop, you will be able to:

- Use SuperCollider and the MIRLC2 library to retrieve sounds from Freesound.org based on a live coding approach.
- Use a trained model using the FluCoMa library to retrieve sounds that are based on personal musical taste.
- Train your own model using the FluCoMa library to retrieve sounds that are based on your personal musical taste.
- Analyse how to define a virtual agent that can react to the live coder inputs using the FluCoMa library.
- Explore creative strategies to perform with a virtual agent using machine learning for live coding.
